## Short guide

After running `npm run build` all html, css and js files are generated in `docs` folder. 
You can use `docs` files for github pages or netlify deployment or maybe even AWS S3. 

## Deployment

- https://www.netlify.com/ (incredibly easy and free hosting for open source)
- https://pages.github.com/ (free and intuitive hosting for static websites)
- https://zeit.co/now (realtime deployments from cli)

```bash
# install now
npm install now -g
# deploy app with now 
now
```
